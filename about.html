    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Presley Chweneyagae was more than just an actor — he was a beacon of hope, a storyteller who brought raw truth and emotion to every role. Watching him in <i>Tsotsi</i> was like witnessing a soul laid bare, vulnerable yet powerful.</p>
    <p>His journey touched countless hearts, including mine. Presley’s courage to show the complexities of life and the depths of human redemption inspired me beyond words. This page is my humble tribute to a man whose light will forever shine, even in the darkest times.</p>
    <p>Fly high, Presley. Your story, your spirit, and your legacy will live on in all who were moved by your gift.</p>
